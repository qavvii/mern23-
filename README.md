# mern stack application 
 MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application, several key libraries are commonly used alongside the core technologies to streamline development, manage state, handle routing, and perform other crucial tasks. Below is a summary of essential libraries you might use in a MERN stack application

 
MongoDB
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.

Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Body-Parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

Cors: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is necessary for allowing your front-end application to interact with your back-end API.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, using a component-based architecture.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's used for building the back-end of MERN applications.
